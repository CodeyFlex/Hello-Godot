### Here's some of the things i worked on in January, whilst checking out if the Godot engine was something i'd be interested in working more within.

* Tips:
  * Press f on boxes to refill them
  * Press f on dog to have it follow you/stop following you
  * Press 0 to unequip gun and play walk animation
  * Press 1 to draw gun once again

* Learned about:
  * Sprite animation
  * Alot of rule based scripting (Shooting, following, watching, damaging, refilling & such.)
  * Creating new instances throughout gameplay (Bullets mainly)
  * Vectors, rotation & animation triggers
  * Coding with documentation mainly
  * A little pixel art in PS
  * Signals (Body enters collision layer & such)
  * Camera control
  * Player and NPC controls
  * Some UI design
  * 2D Tilemaps
  * Pathfinding
